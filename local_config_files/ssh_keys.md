# SSH Keys for GitHub and so on

* [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys) has lot of info
    * "Standard" SSH key pair generation
    * FIDO/UF2 (FIDO2?  Is this WebAuthn???)
        * I'll need to look into this
    * KeePassXC
        * Now I understand what the SSH client integration means.
        * I'll also check this out
* GitHub also has [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    * Here are GitHub's SSH [fingerprints](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints).
