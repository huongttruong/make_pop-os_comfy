# Make Pop!\_OS Comfy

The following files here document what I need to change for Pop!\_OS installed
on the [Surface Pro 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro).

The [Linux Surface kernel](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface) is
**not needed** for the touchscreen and stylus to properly function, as indicated
by the [table](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Supported-Devices-and-Features#surface-tablets)
for the Surface tablets.

There might be 1 more file about "extra" packages for Debian-/Ubuntu-based
installs on better hardware in the future, but what's listed here is at least
95% "there" to completion.

All I know is that I will never try to make my own distro with Debian Unstable
and have a result result worse than what "online experts" will ever say about
Manjaro... I'd expect much better results for my first ever DIY Arch Linux
install with [`archinstall`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) than
a Universe's lifetime of using Debian Unstable for a laptop.

Plain Debian for servers?  Great.

But plain Debian for desktop?  Never again -- I'd rather install plain Ubuntu
again with its weird [eCryptfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECryptfs) setup
["thing"](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1092277/what-is-home-ecryptfs-and-why-does-it-take-up-so-much-space)
that once killed my Ubuntu install because I deleted it without thinking about
any potential consequences.
