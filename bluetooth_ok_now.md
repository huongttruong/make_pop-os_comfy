# Bluetooth ok now

I don't have to permanently the Bluetooth via blacklisting anymore.  Somehow, Pop!\_OS doesn't have that weird Bluetooth glitch, in which Bluetooth keeps turning back on despite manually turning off Bluetooth in the GUI Settings application.

However, the top 3 answers (or whichever that don't involve `rfkill`?) are the solutions I'd try first in this [source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/387502/disable-bluetooth-at-boot).
